    <span class="section-headers">Summary</span>
      <p class="summary-sentence">I'm a full-stack developer looking to build fresh and engaging solutions at the intersection of design, culture and technology. I'm passionate about getting my hands dirty and creating amazing things from the ground-up.<br>

      <br>The photos on the left belong to a piece by the Belgian artist, Francis Al&yuml;s. I love these stills because they portray the process of whittling something enormous down to something weightless. It's akin to the moment of reaching a solution after hours of careful thought and perseverance.</p>
