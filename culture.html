              <br>My cousin and I couldn't be more different: his idea of a good time is climbing a mountain or entering a boxing ring while I prefer curling up on the couch with a book. Yet our differences are the reason why we get along so well; we always teach each other new things, even when we encounter misunderstandings.

              <br><br>A while back, my cousin and I fell into a debate over the merits of a college education. My cousin chose to build his career while I found satisfaction attending classes at a university. Although we each found fulfillment in our different routes, the conversation became more about convincing the other rather than sharing our individual points of view. We both withdrew at the end of our conversation and a sense of anger settled over the table.

              <br><br>My cousin is a wonderful person and I have a tremendous amount of respect for him. He's a fearless entrepreneur, a loyal friend, and one of the most courageous people I know. It was foolish to insist that one person was right. My cousin and I are close and these kinds scuffles are easily forgotten. We cracked a joke that cut through the bad mood and we laughed through the rest of our lunch.

              <br><br>Upon reflection, I'm dismayed by how our spirited conversation turned to frustration. Listening is important, but if I could go back, I would put in more effort to see things from his point of view. There's a lot I could learn about his choices and instead of approaching our differences defensively, it would have been much more exciting to hear about the ways he learned outside of the classroom. Thankfully, I'll get a chance to ask him these questions and anytime I encounter a different point of view, my goal will be learn more about their experience.

              <br>Last week, we discussed Claude M. Steele's research on the ways <a href="http://janeskim.github.io/blog/c6-stereotype-threat.html"><em>stereotype threat</em></a> can limit individuals. Steele also discovered that recognizing one's values and affirming one's sense of self-worth provide important ways to counteract stereotype threat. Our values are deeply personal and often easy to take for granted, but I agree that expressing these principles and evaluating a situation based on these values can be a powerful way to navigate stereotype threat and the fear of failure.

              <br><br>When I think of times in my life when I've been the happiest or the proudest, my life has been filled with vibrancy, adventure and close relationships. Vibrancy conveys a strong sense of self, of confidence and excitement. It is a passionate, infectious energy that I seek in myself and in others. Similarly, adventure is an important motivator; no matter how minor, the heightened sense of possibility and the excitement of a new frontier--be it in the mental, physical or emotional realm--is a wonderful and satisfying thing. Lastly but most importantly, close relationships are a joyful, stabilizing force and I deeply value each person in my life. Recognizing these values allows me to approach difficulty with a game plan; I know I've reached the right place when all of these values are bountiful in my world.

              <br><br>DBC has asked me to recall the last time someone asked me for advice, but when I think about the really great conversations I've had with people, advice has been largely missing. My most memorable conversations often have to do with listening, kindness and vulnerability. As I move forward on my path at DBC and the path that continues after bootcamp, I'll face many challenges on how to grow my skills and continue learning. My world will also expand to include all types of people from colleagues to clients. Through it all, I hope to field my challenges with kindness and vibrancy, and keep a sense of adventure through each obstacle.

            <br>Claude M. Steele is a social psychologist widely recognized for his research on "stereotype threat," a term used to describe the ways negative racial stereotypes affect academic performance in minority students. Through a series of tests conducted on students at Stanford University, Steele discovered that  instructions which seem impartial can actually become associated with negative racial stereotypes. In these instances, minority students became self-conscious about their performance: students worried that their poor academic performance would prove negative stereotypes to be true. Under this anxiety, the test scores of minority students dropped dramatically in comparison to academically equivalent white students. When it comes to race, Steele points out that situations that seem objectively the same for different race groups are experienced quite differently.

            <br><br>Steele's research is important because even when an individual personally experiences stereotype threat, its effects can be hard to describe. Race and race awareness is a powerful force that shapes people in subtle but substantial ways and I'm grateful for Steele's reseach because it gives us a way to talk about something that can often feel amorphous. I haven't experienced stereotype threat in relation to race, but one of the minority groups in Steele's research includes women in math. Girls are often discouraged from entering more "masculine" fields such as math and science, and growing up I was dissuaded from these fields in a variety of small but significant ways. In a commercial earlier this year, Verizon illustrated the overall effect that gender specific comments have on girls and their relationship to STEM fields. After watching the video and reading Steele's ideas, I'm beginning to understand the insidious ways stereotypes limit and define people.

            <br><br>Sadly, the effects of stereotype threat aren't restricted to academic settings and we can see this reflected in the lack of diversity in many professional fields. Still, Steele's research is encouraging because it explores ways we can help dispel stereotype threat. In the case with college students, research showed that when instructors explicitly and genuinely emphasized high, critical standards, the anxiety of being judged racially was significantly reduced. Furthermore, honest and empathetic conversations with other racial groups helped minority students feel as though their concerns weren't solely based on race. Fighting against ingrained ideas of race and gender are difficult to do, but recognizing that stereotype threat exists is the first step towards creating a fair and supportive environment. Google has recently implemented a course for their workplace highlighting the ways unconscious bias can negative influence others. It's a wonderful first step towards bringing more awareness and hopefully equality in the tech world.

            <br><br>We have a responsibility to create an environment where all people feel safe and equal. Conversations about equality are simple in theory but research proves that it's a multi-faceted experience that requires mindfulness, sensitivity and sincerity. It's exciting to see Google taking this important step towards open conversations about how to change the tech industry.

              <br>Peer pairing is a big part of learning at DBC. Aside from a few DBC guides overseeing the message boards and optional office hours and tutoring, we spend most of Phase 0 studying concepts on our own and implementing ideas in pairs with other students. Before I started Phase 0, I was nervous about pairing. DBC emphasized the important of learning from each other but it seemed awkward to work on problems with strangers via videochat and Stypi. Turns out peer pairing is training for being a developer in the real world by cultivating, at the nucleus of our workflow, the ability to communicate and respond to others.

              <br><br>After only a few weeks, pairing feels like a natural and necessary way to tackle new challenges. Each student I've paired with keeps me motivated and focused when I would otherwise be discouraged and mentally exhausted. Two hours I spend working on a challenge alone is not nearly as concentrated as two hours I spend thinking out loud, responding to new ideas and explaining a piece of logic to another person. I've even been lucky enough to pair with students who were more knowledgable and kind enough to guide me at moments where I was struggling. Creativity increases exponentially; after all, two minds are better than one.

              <br><br>Giving feedback is an instructive experience as well. In addition to writing comments, we evaluate our pair according to a set of criteria specified by DBC. We gauge a student on their technical skills as well as their ability to motivate others, demonstrate respect and be an overall awesome person to work with. This set of standards helps me consider myself through the lens of a future coworker. How can I best support them in a work situation? What do I need to do to communicate effectively? Which qualities matter most in a team?

              <br><br>When I first started reading feedback from other students, I learned patterns in my communication and behavior that I didn't know before. In particular, I learned that my greatest weakness is driving while my pair is navigating. Talking and asking questions is important but I have to take the backseat and let my pair flesh out their ideas. Receiving actionable feedback was difficult at first and made me self-conscious about my workflow with other students, but I now recognize it as a way to hone in on improvement. Each time I start a pairing session, I have two goals: one to solve the challenge and another to be a better listener.

              <br>The Atlantic recently published a thoughtful piece, <em><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/the-unsafety-net-how-social-media-turned-against-women/381261/">How Social Media Turned Against Women</a></em>, investigating the ways Facebook, Twitter and YouTube can become hostile and even dangerous platforms for women.

              <br><br>Although Facebook and Twitter have community guidelines identifying acceptable behavior and provide users with tools to report violations, the actual work of regulating is still deeply flawed. In their article, Buni and Chemaly present numerous examples of women who reported graphic and violent harrassment to no effect. Companies explain that the line delineating legitimate threat is blurry and indeed there is a constitutional vagueness when distinguishing a threat from free speech.

              <br><br>The article makes an important distinction that social media is a reflection of the culture at large and violence against women is a global problem, but it's undeniable that social media impacts culture and gender-directed hostility aims to suppress and intimidate women. Free speech is an inalienable right and social media operates on a democratic treatment of content, but companies must take responsibility for the types of conversations they implicitly enable and disseminate.

              <br><br>While doing research on problems in the tech industry, I came upon several articles where women documented invasive and frightening encounters on social media. More recently, indie game developer <a href="http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2014/10/11/yet-another-woman-in-gaming-has-been-driven-from-her-home-by-death-threats/">Brianna Wu</a> was driven from her home due to a series of escalating threats following a set of memes she posted on #GamerGate. <a href="http://time.com/3547936/gamergate-anita-sarkeesian-stephen-colbert/">Anita Sarkeesian</a> has  been vocal about her terrifying experience with #GameGate as well. <a href="https://twitter.com/adriarichards">Adria Richards</a> has been tweeting about her experience getting doxxed after PyCon and even provides advice on how to deal with it since there isn't a lot legal support out there. <a href="http://seriouspony.com/trouble-at-the-koolaid-point">Kathy Sierra</a> wrote about on how a woman's visibility on the internet is reason enough to be a target and <a href="http://juliepagano.com/blog/2014/10/10/life-and-times-of-a-tech-feminist-killjoy-you-cant-go-back-theres-no-end-in-sight/">Julie Pagano</a> explains that her decision to leave the tech community was due to years of feeling unsafe.

              <br><br>Buni and Chemaly compare the importance of online regulation to harassment laws in the office: sexual hostility interferes with life opportunity, which is why the workplace legally defines what is acceptable and safe. Likewise, there are real life consequences to how women are treated in social media: yes, it affects individuals on a personal level but it also affects the tech industry by pushing away great talent and depriving itself of opportunities to improve. Considering the global scope of social media, there's actually an infrastructure in place for greater transparency and constructive conversations. We're just waiting for the tech industry to start setting and maintaining the standard.

              <br>The Gregorc Thinking Style is a model that describes an individual's thinking process through a combination of four criteria: concrete, abstract, sequential and random. Most individuals are a combination of all these descriptors, but the Gregorc Thinking Style tallies these qualities and combines the predominant perceptual quality (concrete or abstract) with a predominant ordering ability (sequential or random).

              <br><br>According to my Gregorc Thinking Style, I lean strongly towards two modes of thinking: concrete sequential and abstract random. Here's a chart explaining what this means.

              <br><br><img id="image_long" src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/a55ba42847d159a9348d4fe29326842d/tumblr_ncxypuH3161tls2v5o1_1280.png" />
              <br><a id="image_link" href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">From SUNY Cortland - Anthony Gregorc</a>

              <br><br>When I consider my progress at DBC under this lens, I see some important ideas emerge. Firstly, I prefer to absorb information by organizing it into a logical sequence. By understanding patterns and laws, I can make predictions and solve problems based off a particular set of expectations. During this week's Ruby challenges, I often found myself wondering "How?" and "Why?" As of now, each solution feels isolated in a logic of its own instead of fitting into a discernible, overlaying pattern. It's valuable to know that my main objective when completing mini challenges is not just executing the code but finding the sweet spot where everything aligns and I see the bigger picture.

              <br><br>To optimize my learning trajectory, it's also important to consider my philosophy towards learning. Carol Dweck's book, <em><a href="http://mindsetonline.com/">Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</a></em> distinguishes two approaches toward learning: growth mindsets and fixed mindsets. The fixed mindset holds qualities such as intelligence and creativity to be innate while the growth mindset believes these qualities can be cultivated. The distinction is important because Dweck points out that each outlook influences how much a person can achieve. Because the fixed mindset seeks success as an affirmation of inherent positive qualities, individuals with fixed mindsets avoid challenges and give up easily. The growth mindset, on the other hand, embraces challenges as a learning opportunity and values effort as necessary for improvement.

              <br><br>I must admit that I've viewed intelligence as a fixed quality but when I consider the ways this viewpoint influences an individual's relationship with achievement, I'm compelled to think otherwise. Dweck's argument is important because it evens the playing field: valuing determination and curiosity over notions of inherent intelligence opens everyone up to a lot more possibility. The growth mindset is all about fearlessness and enthusiasm, and I'll be keeping these qualities in mind as I move through new lessons and setbacks at DBC.

            <br>In his fireside chat, DBC founder Shereef Bishay answers questions from prospective students eager to know more about the program. They have questions about prep and the length of bootcamp phases. They'd like to know the best ways to gauge their skills and manage the workload. They wonder if they are smart enough or good enough to excel as a developer. I hear a lot of myself in their questions because just like them, I'm nervous and excited and I want to do my absolute best.

            <br><br>To answer these questions, Shereef emphasizes EQ over IQ. Students are asked to be communicative about their ignorance and power through until they figure it out. The emphasis is on perseverance, teamwork and vulnerability.

            <br><br>The philosophy behind DBC is important because code languages are only the tip of the web dev iceberg; being excellent to each other is the bigger constant. Becoming a full stack developer means problem solving from the vantage point of a designer and an engineer. It means understanding human needs and asking questions from a place of empathy. Conducting oneself with integrity, supporting a team with patience and humility, being reliable, staying curious--that's what we're striving for.

            <br><br>Learning to code is hard enough, but being supremely awesome at it requires something other than knowledge. I'm going for the gold: kindness and patience and intellectual curiosity, asking questions, attending talks and meet ups, keeping an open mind, tweeting, blogging, reaching out, explaining, trying new things, and failing over and over again until I get it right. In short, I'll be shedding, as gladly as I can, plenty of blood, sweat and tears.

            <br><br>This is the chart to keep in mind. Let's hustle.
