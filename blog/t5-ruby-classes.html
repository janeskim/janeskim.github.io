              <br>Ruby is an <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> language. This means that getting anything done in Ruby requires working with objects: objects contain data and we ask objects to manipulate and return data in useful forms.

              <br><br>Last week we looked into an example of the method <code>#each_by</code> in the <a href="http://janeskim.github.io/t4-enumerable-methods.html">Enumerable module</a>. All the methods in the Enumerable module only work on objects that are lists. This is because different types of objects can only execute certain types of tasks. An object's ability to use a method depends on its <strong>class</strong>.

              <br><br>Let's take a real life example: when we have the numbers "2" and "4" we can complete addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. When we have the words "cat" and "pig", we can't run those mathematical actions on the words. "cat" - "pig" = ? Doesn't work quite the same. If we think about this in Ruby terms, the objects "2" and "4" are in the <strong>class</strong> number and the objects "cat" and "pig" are in the <strong>class</strong> words. Different types of classes have certain characteristics and those classes can execute a specific set of methods.

              <br><br>In Ruby, we can actually create our own classes. We can also create objects that belong to a class and have the objects execute specific tasks. For our example, let's create a class of bikes. What are some of the characteristics a bike has? A bike has a color, wheels, and gears. What kinds of actions can a bike do? The bike can speed up, slow down and come to a full stop. Now, let's translate this into Ruby code.

                <br>This is a very simple example of how to create a new class. First, we declared our new class <code>Bike</code> by capitalizing the name of the class and putting <code>class</code> in front of it. Next, we defined a method called <code>initialize</code>. This method states that objects that belong to the class <code>Bike</code> must specify three characteristics: the color, the wheel size, and the gears. Whenever we declare an object under the class <code>Bike</code>, we  have to supply that object with these characteristics.

                <br><br>We covered some of basic ways to establish the characteristics of our class, so let's move onto methods. Objects within a class can execute specific methods, and we create those methods inside the class definition. In our example, we defined three methods: <code>specs</code>, <code>ride</code> and <code>fixed</code>.

                <br><br>Let's see our new class in action.

                <br>>>turbo.fixed
                <br>"Your bike had 3 gears but now it has 0."
                <br>"Whoops, we turned it into a fixed gear."

                <br>Here we created a new object called <code>turbo</code>, defined it as belonging to the new class <code>Bike</code> and specified three characteristics. We called the methods <code>specs</code>, <code>ride</code> and <code>fixed</code> on the object <code>turbo</code>.

                <br><br>Ruby is a dynamic language and there are many ways to alter objects, add methods and change our classes, but the important thing to know is <strong>every object in Ruby belongs to a class and each class has a distinct set of characteristics and methods</strong>.
