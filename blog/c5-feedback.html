              <br>Peer pairing is a big part of learning at DBC. Aside from a few DBC guides overseeing the message boards and optional office hours and tutoring, we spend most of Phase 0 studying concepts on our own and implementing ideas in pairs with other students. Before I started Phase 0, I was nervous about pairing. DBC emphasized the important of learning from each other but it seemed awkward to work on problems with strangers via videochat and Stypi. Turns out peer pairing is training for being a developer in the real world by cultivating, at the nucleus of our workflow, the ability to communicate and respond to others.

              <br><br>After only a few weeks, pairing feels like a natural and necessary way to tackle new challenges. Each student I've paired with keeps me motivated and focused when I would otherwise be discouraged and mentally exhausted. Two hours I spend working on a challenge alone is not nearly as concentrated as two hours I spend thinking out loud, responding to new ideas and explaining a piece of logic to another person. I've even been lucky enough to pair with students who were more knowledgable and kind enough to guide me at moments where I was struggling. Creativity increases exponentially; after all, two minds are better than one.

              <br><br>Giving feedback is an instructive experience as well. In addition to writing comments, we evaluate our pair according to a set of criteria specified by DBC. We gauge a student on their technical skills as well as their ability to motivate others, demonstrate respect and be an overall awesome person to work with. This set of standards helps me consider myself through the lens of a future coworker. How can I best support them in a work situation? What do I need to do to communicate effectively? Which qualities matter most in a team?

              <br><br>When I first started reading feedback from other students, I learned patterns in my communication and behavior that I didn't know before. In particular, I learned that my greatest weakness is driving while my pair is navigating. Talking and asking questions is important but I have to take the backseat and let my pair flesh out their ideas. Receiving actionable feedback was difficult at first and made me self-conscious about my workflow with other students, but I now recognize it as a way to hone in on improvement. Each time I start a pairing session, I have two goals: one to solve the challenge and another to be a better listener.
