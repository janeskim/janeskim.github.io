            <br>This is my first week of Phase 0 at DBC and already I've learned so much! Unit 1 focused on the basics of <strong>git</strong>, <strong>GitHub</strong>, and the <strong>command line</strong>--all tools that were completely new to me at the start of this week.

            <br><br><strong><u>THE COMMAND LINE</u></strong>

            <br><br>Let's start off by simply defining the <strong>command line</strong>. You know how you find files and folders on your Mac using Finder? The command line goes many layers underneath the visual functionality of Finder to execute similar tasks such as finding folders and files and installing software. The command line is an extremely powerful tool and I'm only hitting the surface of it, but it can essentially be described the heart of the computer.

            <br><br><strong><u>GIT</u></strong>

            <br><br>To talk about git and GitHub, we first have to talk about <strong>version control</strong>. Version control is a software that keeps track of all the versions of a project and <strong>git is a version control software you install onto your computer</strong> using the command line. To understand how git works, imagine a tree: we have the main project, which is the trunk of our tree, called the <strong>master</strong> branch. In order to work on the project, git creates copies of the master branch and calls these copies <strong>branches</strong>. Since branches are copies of the project, they don't affect the master, and users can experiment within the branches to try out new ideas. When a branch contains a functionality that is awesome enough to be a part of the final product, we merge the branch onto the master using three steps: <strong>add</strong>, <strong>commit</strong> and <strong>push</strong>. As for the branches we don't want? We can simply delete those.

            <br><br>Because we add branches onto the master, git keeps track of all the changes made on a project through a collection of snapshots. The <strong>git log</strong> tracks all the versions of the project that came before, like a photo album of the work in progress. This is great because you can always travel back to a specific version--whether it be for debugging or experimenting--and work on the project at that particular state. Nothing is lost, all is carefully documented, and disaster is averted.

            <br><br><strong><u>GITHUB</u></strong>

            <br><br>We've covered git, so what about <strong>GitHub</strong>? First off, it's important to note that GitHub is different from git. While git is a piece of software that exists locally on your computer, <strong>GitHub exists remotely on the internet</strong>. Although different, the two are not separate because git and GitHub work together. By syncing git on our computer to GitHub on the internet, we can send the work we do on our computer to GitHub using the git commands, add, commit and push. We also take projects from GitHub onto our computers, and these commands are called <strong>pull</strong> or <strong>fetch</strong>.

            <br><br>Here's a diagram to explain the git and GitHub workflow:
            <br><br><img id="image_long" src="http://38.media.tumblr.com/9564bf62c603806373c257a848af233a/tumblr_ndcmpz0ooH1tls2v5o1_1280.png" />
            <br><a id="image_link" href="http://thkoch2001.github.io/whygitisbetter/">From Scott Chacon</a>

            <br><br>Lastly, it's important to note git and GitHub are essentially collaborating tools and we must view the master branch as something untouchable and holy. It's the source code that many others are drawing from and adding to. As a result, there's usually a check/balance system where your pushed changes are reviewed by another team member before it's merged onto the master branch. In other words, when working on a project we can merge onto the master branch and we can draw from the master branch but <strong>we must never work on the master branch itself</strong>.
