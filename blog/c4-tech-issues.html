              <br>The Atlantic recently published a thoughtful piece, <em><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/the-unsafety-net-how-social-media-turned-against-women/381261/">How Social Media Turned Against Women</a></em>, investigating the ways Facebook, Twitter and YouTube can become hostile and even dangerous platforms for women.

              <br><br>Although Facebook and Twitter have community guidelines identifying acceptable behavior and provide users with tools to report violations, the actual work of regulating is still deeply flawed. In their article, Buni and Chemaly present numerous examples of women who reported graphic and violent harrassment to no effect. Companies explain that the line delineating legitimate threat is blurry and indeed there is a constitutional vagueness when distinguishing a threat from free speech.

              <br><br>The article makes an important distinction that social media is a reflection of the culture at large and violence against women is a global problem, but it's undeniable that social media impacts culture and gender-directed hostility aims to suppress and intimidate women. Free speech is an inalienable right and social media operates on a democratic treatment of content, but companies must take responsibility for the types of conversations they implicitly enable and disseminate.

              <br><br>While doing research on problems in the tech industry, I came upon several articles where women documented invasive and frightening encounters on social media. More recently, indie game developer <a href="http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2014/10/11/yet-another-woman-in-gaming-has-been-driven-from-her-home-by-death-threats/">Brianna Wu</a> was driven from her home due to a series of escalating threats following a set of memes she posted on #GamerGate. <a href="http://time.com/3547936/gamergate-anita-sarkeesian-stephen-colbert/">Anita Sarkeesian</a> has  been vocal about her terrifying experience with #GameGate as well. <a href="https://twitter.com/adriarichards">Adria Richards</a> has been tweeting about her experience getting doxxed after PyCon and even provides advice on how to deal with it since there isn't a lot legal support out there. <a href="http://seriouspony.com/trouble-at-the-koolaid-point">Kathy Sierra</a> wrote about on how a woman's visibility on the internet is reason enough to be a target and <a href="http://juliepagano.com/blog/2014/10/10/life-and-times-of-a-tech-feminist-killjoy-you-cant-go-back-theres-no-end-in-sight/">Julie Pagano</a> explains that her decision to leave the tech community was due to years of feeling unsafe.

              <br><br>Buni and Chemaly compare the importance of online regulation to harassment laws in the office: sexual hostility interferes with life opportunity, which is why the workplace legally defines what is acceptable and safe. Likewise, there are real life consequences to how women are treated in social media: yes, it affects individuals on a personal level but it also affects the tech industry by pushing away great talent and depriving itself of opportunities to improve. Considering the global scope of social media, there's actually an infrastructure in place for greater transparency and constructive conversations. We're just waiting for the tech industry to start setting and maintaining the standard.
