              <br>The <code>Gregorc Thinking Style</code> is a model that describes an individual's thinking process through a combination of four criteria: <code>concrete</code>, <code>abstract</code>, <code>sequential</code> and <code>random</code>.

              <br><br>The <code>concrete</code> and <code>abstract</code> descriptors refer to perception, or the way an individual receives information. Concrete perceivers take information through the senses and focus on what is presently available. Abstract perceivers visualize and imagine, and they are often guided by intuition. <code>Sequential</code> and <code>random</code> refer to the ways a mind organizes information: sequential thinkers prefer linear patterns and planning while random thinkers organize information into chunks and move between these segments without any particular order. Most individuals are a combination of all these descriptors, but the Gregorc Thinking Style tallies these qualities and combines the <code>predominant perceptual quality</code> (concrete or abstract) with a <code>predominant ordering ability</code> (sequential or random).

              <br><br>According to my Gregorc Thinking Style, I lean strongly towards two modes of thinking: <code>concrete sequential</code> and <code>abstract random</code>. Here's a chart explaining what this means.

              <br><br><img id="image_long" src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/a55ba42847d159a9348d4fe29326842d/tumblr_ncxypuH3161tls2v5o1_1280.png" />

              <br><br>When I consider my progress at DBC under this lens, I see some important ideas emerge. Firstly, I prefer to absorb information by organizing it into a logical sequence. By understanding patterns and laws, I can make predictions and solve problems based off a particular set of expectations. For example, during this week's Ruby challenges, I often found myself wondering "How?" and "Why?" As of now, each solution feels isolated in a logic of its own instead of fitting into a discernible, overlaying pattern. It's valuable to know that my main objective when completing mini challenges is not just executing the code but finding the sweet spot where everything aligns and I see the bigger picture.

              <br><br>More recently, I had a great breakthrough during an office hours session with a DBC guide. Cooperation and amicability are important for abstract random thinkers, and I hold this to be true for myself. The open dialogue I was able to have with my guide was elemental to my understanding of the material, and my community of fellow students has pulled me out of several creative ruts this week. I'm reminded time and time again of the benefits of open discourse with a motivated group of students and teachers.

              <br><br>Lastly, when optimizing my learning trajectory, it's important to consider my philosophy towards learning. Carol Dweck's book, <i>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</i> separates this approach into two groups: <code>growth mindsets</code> and <code>fixed mindsets</code>. The fixed mindset holds qualities such as intelligence and creativity to be innate while the growth mindset believes these qualities can be cultivated. Dweck argues that each outlook influences how much a person can achieve.

              <br><br>The fixed mindset seeks success as affirmation of these inherent positive qualities, while the growth mindset is embraces challenges as opportunity to refine them. Society in general holds intelligence to be inherited (after all children are tested for IQ and placed in specific classrooms) but emphasizing determination as a pivotal outlook is a radical standpoint that evens the playing field. The growth mindset appeals to me because it alludes to a certain sense of fearlessness and enthusiasm. Knowing that these qualities can carry you farther than a reliance on static, inherited traits is an encouraging challenge to be tenacious as I move through new lessons and setbacks at DBC.
