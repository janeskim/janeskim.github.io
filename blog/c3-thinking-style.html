              <br>The Gregorc Thinking Style is a model that describes an individual's thinking process through a combination of four criteria: concrete, abstract, sequential and random. Most individuals are a combination of all these descriptors, but the Gregorc Thinking Style tallies these qualities and combines the predominant perceptual quality (concrete or abstract) with a predominant ordering ability (sequential or random).

              <br><br>According to my Gregorc Thinking Style, I lean strongly towards two modes of thinking: concrete sequential and abstract random. Here's a chart explaining what this means.

              <br><br><img id="image_long" src="https://33.media.tumblr.com/a55ba42847d159a9348d4fe29326842d/tumblr_ncxypuH3161tls2v5o1_1280.png" />

              <br><br>When I consider my progress at DBC under this lens, I see some important ideas emerge. Firstly, I prefer to absorb information by organizing it into a logical sequence. By understanding patterns and laws, I can make predictions and solve problems based off a particular set of expectations. During this week's Ruby challenges, I often found myself wondering "How?" and "Why?" As of now, each solution feels isolated in a logic of its own instead of fitting into a discernible, overlaying pattern. It's valuable to know that my main objective when completing mini challenges is not just executing the code but finding the sweet spot where everything aligns and I see the bigger picture.

              <br><br>More recently, I had a great breakthrough during an office hours session with a DBC guide. Cooperation and amicability are important for abstract random thinkers, and I hold this to be true for myself. The open dialogue I was able to have with my guide was elemental to my understanding of the material, and the community of Phase 0 students has pulled me out of several creative ruts this week. I'm reminded time and time again of the benefits of collaborating with a motivated group of students and teachers.

              <br><br>Lastly, when optimizing my learning trajectory, it's important to consider my philosophy towards learning. Carol Dweck's book, <i>Mindset: The New Psychology of Success</i> separates this approach into two groups: growth mindsets and fixed mindsets. The fixed mindset holds qualities such as intelligence and creativity to be innate while the growth mindset believes these qualities can be cultivated. Dweck argues that each outlook influences how much a person can achieve.

              <br><br>The fixed mindset seeks success as an affirmation of inherent positive qualities, while the growth mindset embraces challenges as opportunity to refine them. I must admit that I've viewed intelligence as a fixed quality but when I consider the ways this viewpoint influences an individual's relationship with achievement, I'm compelled to think otherwise. Dweck's argument is important because it evens the playing field: valuing determination and curiosity over notions of inherent intelligence opens everyone up to a lot more possibility. The growth mindset alludes to a certain sense of fearlessness and enthusiasm, and knowing that these qualities can carry you further than a reliance on static traits is a great way of framing frustration as I move through new lessons and setbacks at DBC.
