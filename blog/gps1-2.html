            <strong>What is pair programming?</strong>
            <br>Pair programming is when two or more individuals work together to complete a project. At DBC we pair or team up with another student to complete challenges for the week. In the workplace, developers often work in teams to solve problems together as opposed to working alone.</p>
        <p id="2">
            <strong>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</strong>
            <br>Pair programming is important to DBC because it allows us to get to know one another and learn from each other. It helps us to become better communicators when we are working in teams.</p>

            <strong>Compare Driver and Navigator</strong>
            <br>The driver is the person writing the code and listening to the navigator. The navigator is keeping the idea for what we want to do. However the driver and the navigator are a team, and they give each other input for the direction of the project.</p>

            <strong>My Reflection</strong>
            <br>This is actually my second time pairing with Vianney. He is an excellent pair and I always enjoy working with him because he is knowledgable, patient and communicative. He also cheerful and has a great attitude when it comes to working together. Upon reflection, I realize that I do too much navigating during my pairing sessions. I often feel worried about being too passive and not contributing to the work, but I think I'm just stressing myself out about it. I will make a concerted effort on taking a backseat when driving and let my pair to direct our process in future sessions.
