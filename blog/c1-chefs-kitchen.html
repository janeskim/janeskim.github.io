            In his fireside chat, Shereef answers questions from prospective DBC students eager to know more about the program. They have questions about prep and the length of bootcamp phases, and they'd like to know the best ways to gauge their skills and manage the workload. The students ask, "How much should I figure out on my own and when is it too much research? Is it okay to look at my colleagues' work? What about my IQ? Am I smart enough for this?" I hear a lot of myself in their questions because just like them, I'm nervous and excited and I want to do my very best.

            <br><br>The upcoming weeks will be challenging. Limits will be tested! Ultimately I'm here at DBC to be vulnerable, to expose my ignorance in order to truly learn. Shereef describes the classroom as a "safe and rigorous environment" because learning involves being honest about what you don't know and powering through until you figure it out. And dudes, I am ready for it.

            <br><br>Understanding the philosophy behind DBC is important because code languages are only the tip of the web dev iceberg; being excellent to each other is the bigger constant. Becoming a full stack developer means problem solving from the vantage point of a designer and an engineer. It means understanding human needs and asking questions from a place of compassionate knowledge. Developers work closely in teams and conducting oneself with kindness and principle is a valuable asset. Being a developer also means participating in a vibrant community by sharing knowledge and supporting others. As a person loathed to social media, leaving comments and tweeting is really hard for me to do. Now don't get me wrong, understanding the ins and outs of git wasn't a breeze, but tweeting was personally the most difficult part of week 1! But I'm embracing this as an opportunity to come out of my comfort zone and improve.

            <br><br>Here are the qualities DBC holds most valuable:
            <br>-persistence
            <br>-humility
            <br>-empathy
            <br>-ability to tolerate frustration
            <br>-self-awareness
            <br>-mindfulness
            <br>-curiosity
            <br>-leadership
            <br>-reliability
            <br>-integrity

            <br><br>Looking at this list, I think, "These are virtues everyone should strive for, regardless of web dev dreams!" Coding is hard, but embodying these characteristics while struggling is harder. In addition to learning Ruby/Javascript/HTML/CSS/all the good stuff, my goal is to be honest about myself to my colleagues and available to help all of us succeed as a group. I anticipate I will grow both intellectually and personally and learn a lot about myself during the process. Alright then, let's do this!
