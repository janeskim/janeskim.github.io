            <br>In his fireside chat, DBC founder Shereef Bishay answers questions from prospective students eager to know more about the program. They have questions about prep and the length of bootcamp phases. They'd like to know the best ways to gauge their skills and manage the workload. They wonder if they are smart enough or good enough to excel as a developer. I hear a lot of myself in their questions because just like them, I'm nervous and excited and I want to do my absolute best.

            <br><br>To answer these questions, Shereef emphasizes EQ over IQ. Students are asked to be communicative about their ignorance and power through until they figure it out. The emphasis is on perseverance, teamwork and vulnerability.

            <br><br>The philosophy behind DBC is important because code languages are only the tip of the web dev iceberg; being excellent to each other is the bigger constant. Becoming a full stack developer means problem solving from the vantage point of a designer and an engineer. It means understanding human needs and asking questions from a place of empathy. Conducting oneself with integrity, supporting a team with patience and humility, being reliable, staying curious--that's what we're striving for.

            <br><br>Learning to code is hard enough, but being supremely awesome at it requires something other than knowledge. I'm going for the gold: kindness and patience and intellectual curiosity, asking questions, attending talks and meet ups, keeping an open mind, tweeting, blogging, reaching out, explaining, trying new things, and failing over and over again until I get it right. In short, I'll be shedding, as gladly as I can, plenty of blood, sweat and tears.

            <br><br>This is the chart to keep in mind. Let's hustle.
