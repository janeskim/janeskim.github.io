            <br>Claude M. Steele is a social psychologist widely recognized for his research on "stereotype threat," a term used to describe the ways negative racial stereotypes affect academic performance in minority students. Through a series of tests conducted on students at Stanford University, Steele discovered that  instructions which seem impartial can actually become associated with negative racial stereotypes. In these instances, minority students became self-conscious about their performance: students worried that their poor academic performance would prove negative stereotypes to be true. Under this anxiety, the test scores of minority students dropped dramatically in comparison to academically equivalent white students. When it comes to race, Steele points out that situations that seem objectively the same for different race groups are experienced quite differently.

            <br><br>Steele's research is important because even when an individual personally experiences stereotype threat, its effects can be hard to describe. Race and race awareness is a powerful force that shapes people in subtle but substantial ways and I'm grateful for Steele's reseach because it gives us a way to talk about something that can often feel amorphous. I haven't experienced stereotype threat in relation to race, but one of the minority groups in Steele's research includes women in math. Girls are often discouraged from entering more "masculine" fields such as math and science, and growing up I was dissuaded from these fields in a variety of small but significant ways. In a commercial earlier this year, Verizon illustrated the overall effect that gender specific comments have on girls and their relationship to STEM fields. After watching the video and reading Steele's ideas, I'm beginning to understand the insidious ways stereotypes limit and define people.

            <br><br>Sadly, the effects of stereotype threat aren't restricted to academic settings and we can see this reflected in the lack of diversity in many professional fields. Still, Steele's research is encouraging because it explores ways we can help dispel stereotype threat. In the case with college students, research showed that when instructors explicitly and genuinely emphasized high, critical standards, the anxiety of being judged racially was significantly reduced. Furthermore, honest and empathetic conversations with other racial groups helped minority students feel as though their concerns weren't solely based on race. Fighting against ingrained ideas of race and gender are difficult to do, but recognizing that stereotype threat exists is the first step towards creating a fair and supportive environment. Google has recently implemented a course for their workplace highlighting the ways unconscious bias can negative influence others. It's a wonderful first step towards bringing more awareness and hopefully equality in the tech world.

            <br><br>We have a responsibility to create an environment where all people feel safe and equal. Conversations about equality are simple in theory but research proves that it's a multi-faceted experience that requires mindfulness, sensitivity and sincerity. It's exciting to see Google taking this important step towards open conversations about how to change the tech industry.
