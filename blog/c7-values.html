              <br>Last week, we discussed Claude M. Steele's research on the ways <a href="http://janeskim.github.io/blog/c6-stereotype-threat.html"><em>stereotype threat</em></a> can limit individuals. Steele also discovered that recognizing one's values and affirming one's sense of self-worth provide important ways to counteract stereotype threat. Our values are deeply personal and often easy to take for granted, but I agree that expressing these principles and evaluating a situation based on these values can be a powerful way to navigate stereotype threat and the fear of failure.

              <br><br>When I think of times in my life when I've been the happiest or the proudest, my life has been filled with vibrancy, adventure and close relationships. Vibrancy conveys a strong sense of self, of confidence and excitement. It is a passionate, infectious energy that I seek in myself and in others. Similarly, adventure is an important motivator; no matter how minor, the heightened sense of possibility and the excitement of a new frontier--be it in the mental, physical or emotional realm--is a wonderful and satisfying thing. Lastly but most importantly, close relationships are a joyful, stabilizing force and I deeply value each person in my life. Recognizing these values allows me to approach difficulty with a game plan; I know I've reached the right place when all of these values are bountiful in my world.

              <br><br>DBC has asked me to recall the last time someone asked me for advice, but when I think about the really great conversations I've had with people, advice has been largely missing. My most memorable conversations often have to do with listening, kindness and vulnerability. As I move forward on my path at DBC and the path that continues after bootcamp, I'll face many challenges on how to grow my skills and continue learning. My world will also expand to include all types of people from colleagues to clients. Through it all, I hope to field my challenges with kindness and vibrancy, and keep a sense of adventure through each obstacle.
