              <br>My cousin and I couldn't be more different: his idea of a good time is climbing a mountain or entering a boxing ring while I prefer curling up on the couch with a book. Yet our differences are the reason why we get along so well; we always teach each other new things, even when we encounter misunderstandings.

              <br><br>A while back, my cousin and I fell into a debate over the merits of a college education. My cousin chose to build his career while I found satisfaction attending classes at a university. Although we each found fulfillment in our different routes, the conversation became more about convincing the other rather than sharing our individual points of view. We both withdrew at the end of our conversation and a sense of anger settled over the table.

              <br><br>My cousin is a wonderful person and I have a tremendous amount of respect for him. He's a fearless entrepreneur, a loyal friend, and one of the most courageous people I know. It was foolish to insist that one person was right. My cousin and I are close and these kinds scuffles are easily forgotten. We cracked a joke that cut through the bad mood and we laughed through the rest of our lunch.

              <br><br>Upon reflection, I'm dismayed by how our spirited conversation turned to frustration. Listening is important, but if I could go back, I would put in more effort to see things from his point of view. There's a lot I could learn about his choices and instead of approaching our differences defensively, it would have been much more exciting to hear about the ways he learned outside of the classroom. Thankfully, I'll get a chance to ask him these questions and anytime I encounter a different point of view, my goal will be learn more about their experience.
